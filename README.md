Title: Procedural C++ Bank Management System Repository

Description:
This repository contains a procedural implementation of a Bank Management System using C++. The system is designed to provide essential banking functionalities such as account opening, money deposit, money withdrawal, and account information retrieval.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: The system includes a password-based login mechanism to ensure secure access to user accounts.

2. Account Opening: Users can open new bank accounts by providing necessary information such as name, address, contact number, age, sex, blood group, CNIC, and PIN code. Each account is assigned a unique account number.

3. Money Deposit: Users can deposit money into their accounts by specifying the amount. The system updates the account balance accordingly.

4. Money Withdrawal: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, ensuring that sufficient funds are available. The system deducts the withdrawn amount from the account balance.

5. Account Information: Users can view their account information, including personal details, transaction history, and total balance.

6. Information about the Bank: The system provides information about the bank, such as its policies, services, and contact details.

7. Error Handling: The system includes error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as insufficient funds during withdrawals.

Please note that this implementation follows a procedural programming style and may not utilize object-oriented programming concepts. It serves as a foundational example for building a bank management system and can be used as a starting point for further enhancements and customization based on specific requirements.
